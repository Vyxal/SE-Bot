        I've read every book. I've burned every book. I've won every game. I've lost
        every game. I've appeased everyone. I've killed everyone. Sets of numbers...
        Lines of dialog... I've seen them all.
    - >-
        You...! I'll keep you here no matter what! _Even if it means killing you
        1,000,000 times!_

        Don't you get it? This is all just a game... if you leave the underground
        satisfied, you'll "WIN" the game. And if you win, you won't want to play
        with me anymore

        understand

        So you were able to play by your own rules. You spared the life of a single

    - >-
        ...What are you doing? Do you really think I've learned anything from this?
        No. Sparing me won't change anything.
    - And you know what the best part is? This is all YOUR fault!
    - >-
        Let's destroy everything in this wretched world. Everyone, everything in
        these worthless memories... Let's turn 'em all to dust.
    - _that's a wonderful idea!_
    - >-
        At first, I used my powers for good. I became "friends" with everyone. I
        solved all their problems flawlessly. Their companionship was amusing... For
        a while.
    - >-
        It doesn't matter now. I'm so tired of this, Chara. I'm tired of all these
        people. I'm tired of all these places. I'm tired of being a flower.
